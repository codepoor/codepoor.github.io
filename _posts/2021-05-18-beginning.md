title: The beginning
---

This is the beginning of "codepoor". It's not a great name, it's just a username that was available on GitHub.

Although this person isn't really a new person, this person is me. Everything I write will be honest thoughts and opinions that I have, but the idea is that you, anyone reading this, doesn't know who I am.

I have no idea if I can successfully keep my identity secret. I hope I can, because the intention here is to write down thoughts and feelings that I don't feel able to express publicly as myself.

I've never written anything anonymous before, or tried to maintain an anonymous identity. I guess I'm a bit nervous about it. But then, maybe it will help me write things without worrying about judgement.

I've run out of time for now, I'm gonna leave this here until next time.
